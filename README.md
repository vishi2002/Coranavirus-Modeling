# Coranavirus-Modeling
An SIR Model of the Coronavirus using Differential Equations (Calc II) and Euler's Method.

Here is the link to a video where I explain both the Calculus and Java behind the program and what it entails: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mUeJhuiwXJSYx2AUJ5hZE6xouknG4V_6/view?usp=sharing
